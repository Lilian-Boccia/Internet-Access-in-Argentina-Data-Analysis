# Internet Access in Argentina: A Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of internet access trends, demographics, and technology usage in Argentina. Using publicly available datasets and advanced visualizations in Tableau, the study explores how connectivity has evolved over time, its implications, and opportunities for growth.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to understand the dynamics of internet access in Argentina, uncover insights, and highlight key trends using reliable datasets. The findings aim to support strategic decision-making and foster investments in technology and infrastructure.

**Key Insights**

- Argentina ranks 3rd in South America for internet access, with a 40 percentage-point increase in connectivity over the past decade.
- Mobile phones are the primary mode of access, with over 121% penetration in 2020 compared to only 21% broadband subscriptions.
- The country heavily imports technology products ($3.65 billion in 2020) while steadily growing its technology service exports, reaching $6.27 billion annually.
- Public initiatives are underway to expand broadband access and close the digital divide.

**Methodology**

1. Workflow

- Defined project objectives and strategic questions to guide the analysis.
